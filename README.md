Quick setup steps (launch in under 1 hour)
-----------------------------------------
1. Edit placeholders:
   - Replace 'Luuka Cleaning Company', atumathomas@icloud.com, and 'Columbus, Ohio' in the HTML files.
   - In booking.html, replace 'in person'.
   - In contact.html, replace the Formspree action URL with your Formspree form endpoint (or replace with another form handler).

2. Hosting:
   - Upload all files to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or your web host).
   - If using a cPanel host, zip the files and upload via File Manager, then extract into public_html (or the site root).

3. Domain:
   - Point your domain (e.g., example.com) to your host; follow your host's DNS instructions.

4. Contact form:
   - This template uses Formspree for contact handling. Sign up at https://formspree.io/, create a form, and replace the action URL.
   - If you prefer email notifications without third-party services, you'll need a backend; I can help with that.
